# Docker Compose seems Powerful, why do we need anything else, such as Kubernetes

Docker compose = 1 nodes only
Kubernetes = Cluster 
Rancher = Mnage mulitple clusters in different cloud

Production environment, would most likely need stuff like:
- Health Check
- Load Balancing
- Scaling
- Service Discovery
- Secrets Management
- Application Templating
- Service Orchestration
- Scheduling
- Configuration Management
- Upgrade Management
- User Managment/RBAC
- Software Define Networking (SDN)
- Montoring
- Log Management
